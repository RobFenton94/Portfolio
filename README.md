# My Python Coding Journey

## Welcome to My GitHub Portfolio!

Hello! I'm Rob, a passionate and dedicated beginner in the world of software development. Over the past three months, I have immersed myself in learning Python, focusing on writing clean, efficient code, understanding the intricacies of software programming, and mastering the art of testing to ensure robust and error-free code.

## About Me

- **Name:** Rob Fenton
- **Background:** Aspiring software developer
- **Learning Journey:** 3 months of intensive Python learning
- **Focus Areas:** 
  - Writing clean and readable code
  - Software programming principles
  - Effective testing and debugging

## My Projects

In this portfolio, you will find a collection of projects that demonstrate my skills and what I have learned so far. These three projects highlight my ability to solve problems, write efficient code, and develop software that meets requirements.

### Project 1: Client Data and Student Registration Processor
Description: This project consists of two connected scripts that handle client data and student registration. The first script (dob.py) reads and processes client names and dates of birth from a text file, while the second script (student_register.py) collects student registration details and writes them to a file for record-keeping. Together, these scripts demonstrate file handling, string manipulation, and basic user interaction in Python.

### Key Features:
### dob.py:

Reads data from a text file (DOB.txt).
Extracts and processes client names and birthdates.
Stores the data in separate lists and prints them.

### student_register.py:
Collects the number of students and their IDs from the user.
Writes student IDs and placeholders for signatures to a file (reg_form.txt).

### Technologies Used:
Python, File handling, String manipulation, User input

### Project 2: Sorting and Searching with Unit Testing
Description: This project implements and tests sorting and searching algorithms. It includes binary search, insertion sort, and linear search algorithms, and uses Python's unittest framework to validate their correctness. This project demonstrates algorithm implementation, unit testing, and how to use binary search for efficient data retrieval in sorted arrays.

### Key Features:
Implements binary search, insertion sort, and linear search algorithms.
Uses unittest to create test cases ensuring the correctness of the algorithms.
Provides a comparison between linear and binary search efficiency.
Demonstrates sorting an array using insertion sort and then searching for elements.

### Technologies Used:
Python, Unit testing, Algorithm implementation

### Project 3: Minesweeper Grid Generator
Description: This project creates a Minesweeper grid where each cell is either a mine (#) or a count of adjacent mines. It showcases grid manipulation, adjacency checking, and implementing classic game mechanics in Python.

### Key Features:
Generates a Minesweeper grid from an input grid.
Replaces empty cells (-) with the count of adjacent mines.
Utilizes adjacency checks to count nearby mines for each cell.

### Technologies Used:
Python, Grid manipulation

### Project 4: Holiday Cost Calculator
Description: This project helps users plan a holiday by allowing them to select a destination, the number of nights at a hotel, and the number of days for car rental. It calculates the total cost based on the user's choices, demonstrating user input handling, conditional logic, and basic arithmetic operations in Python.

### Key Features:
Allows users to select a destination, number of hotel nights, and car rental days.
Validates user input for the number of nights and rental days.
Calculates the total cost of the holiday, including flight, hotel, and car rental costs.
Prints a summary of the user's choices and the total cost.

### Technologies Used:
Python, User input handling, Conditional logic, Arithmetic operations

### Project 5: Student Database Management with SQL
Description: This project demonstrates the creation and manipulation of a student database using SQL. It covers creating a table, inserting records, updating entries, querying data, and deleting records and the entire table. This project highlights SQL skills in database management and manipulation.

### Key Features:
Table Creation: Defines a Student table with fields for student number, surname, first name, initial, start date, course code, and project number.
Data Insertion: Inserts multiple rows into the Student table.
Data Query: Selects and displays records based on specific criteria.
Data Update: Updates records based on specified conditions.
Data Deletion: Deletes specific records and the entire Student table.

### Technologies Used:
SQL, Database management

## Looking Forward

I am currently seeking my first job in software development, where I can contribute to real-world projects and continue to grow my skills. I am eager to apply my knowledge and enthusiasm for coding in a professional setting and to collaborate with experienced developers.
