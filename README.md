# Personal Portfolio
# My Python Coding Journey
# Welcome to My GitHub Portfolio!

Hello! I'm Rob, a passionate and dedicated beginner in the world of software development. Over the past three months, I've immersed myself in learning Python and software engineering concepts, focusing on writing clean, efficient code and mastering essential programming principles. In my Software Engineering Bootcamp, I achieved a 99% out of 100% overall grade for Completeness, Efficiency, Style, and Documentation.

# My Projects
This portfolio showcases five projects that demonstrate my skills and what I have learned. These projects highlight my ability to work with functions, file I/O, object-oriented programming, unit testing, and database management with SQL.

# Task 1: Holiday Cost Calculator with User-Defined Functions
Description: This project is a user-friendly holiday cost calculator that guides users through selecting a destination, the number of hotel nights, and car rental days. The program then calculates the total cost based on these inputs, leveraging user-defined functions to organize and execute calculations.

# Key Features:

Provides a list of destinations with pre-set prices for each location.
Collects user input for destination choice, hotel nights, and car rental days.
Uses functions to calculate and print the total holiday cost based on user choices.
Technologies Used: Python, Functions, User input handling, Conditional logic, Arithmetic operations

# Task 2: File I/O and Data Processing
Description: This task involves two scripts that work with file I/O to manage client and student registration data. The first script (dob_task.py) reads client names and dates of birth from a text file and organizes them into separate lists, while the second script (student_register.py) creates a registration file by capturing student details and writing them to a file for record-keeping.

# Key Features:

dob_task.py: Reads and processes client names and birthdates from a text file (DOB.txt), storing them in lists for easy access and display.
student_register.py: Collects student registration details, including student IDs, and writes them to a formatted registration file (reg_form.txt).
Technologies Used: Python, File handling, String manipulation, Data processing

# Task 3: Email Simulation with Object-Oriented Programming
Description: This task demonstrates basic object-oriented programming (OOP) principles through an email simulator application. It includes two classes: Email to represent individual emails and EmailSimulator to manage an inbox of emails. Users can populate their inbox with sample emails, mark emails as read, and view unread emails.

# Key Features:

Email Class: Represents an email with attributes for address, subject, content, and read status.
EmailSimulator Class: Manages a list of email objects and allows the user to view, read, and mark emails as read.
Implements a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the inbox.
Technologies Used: Python, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Classes, Methods, User interaction

# Task 4: Sorting and Searching Algorithms with Unit Testing
Description: This project implements and tests sorting and searching algorithms, including binary search, insertion sort, and linear search. The task also includes unit tests for each algorithm using Python's unittest framework to ensure accuracy and functionality.

# Key Features:

Binary Search: Efficiently searches for elements in a sorted list, demonstrating the advantages of binary over linear search for large datasets.
Insertion Sort: Sorts a list of integers, highlighting the algorithm's approach to arranging data.
Unit Testing: Validates the correctness of sorting and searching functions through test cases, ensuring robust and reliable code.
Technologies Used: Python, Algorithm implementation, Unit testing, unittest framework

# Task 5: SQL Database Management
Description: This project involves creating and managing a student database using SQL. The project demonstrates various SQL operations such as creating tables, inserting records, querying data, updating records, and deleting both specific entries and entire tables.

# Key Features:

Table Creation: Defines a Student table with fields for student number, name, start date, course code, and project number.
Data Insertion: Inserts sample student records into the database.
Data Query and Update: Retrieves records based on criteria, updates course codes and project numbers, and deletes specific records.
Table Deletion: Demonstrates dropping the entire table.
Technologies Used: SQL, Database management

# Looking Forward
I am currently seeking my first job in software development, where I can contribute to real-world projects and continue to grow my skills. I am eager to apply my knowledge and enthusiasm for coding in a professional setting and to collaborate with experienced developers.
